This repository contains questions for the final exam, with IntelliJ project configurations.

## WARNING!
You must commit and push your work to the exam GitLab server, and ensure your work is pushed successfully 
to the server before the end of the exam. We can only mark what you have pushed. Anything that
you forget to push will be irretrievably lost.

### Instructions
- In the `Integrity.md`, do **NOT** change the date and other parts of the file structure. Only fill in your name, UID (same as info for your GitLab account) and Q1-3.
- The results of CI shall indicate whether your project pass compliance and could compile.
- Do not import non-standard Java libraries.
- The files to be submitted are specified in each questions.
  Note that the files should remain in their original locations in the repository (i.e. not moved), 
  and any other files will not be included during marking.

- A partially correct implementation (i.e., one that passes some tests
  but not all) will usually receive some marks. (There are exceptions,
  for example in cases where a “dummy” implementation, such as always
  returning false, happens to pass a certain test; then there will be no
  marks for passing that particular test only). However, marks are not
  necessarily proportional to the number of tests passed.

### Recap of Important Notes (From Essential Guide for the Final Exam)
- Commit and push your work regularly as you complete it.
  Remember that we can only mark what is in your exam repository on
  the GitLab server after the exam.

- Do **NOT** wait to the end of the exam to push all your solutions.
  Close to the end of the exam (last 10-15 minutes), the exam server is
  likely to be very busy, and pushing can take much longer than normal.
  *Be prepared for that - don't leave pushing to the last minute!*

- The CI will work differently than in the labs. 
  - It is also necessary for you to pass the compliance stage to get marked.  
  - We will only provide some basic test cases to you (in the repository, as well as the CI).  
  - Your code will be assessed with another set of test cases that are not provided, and the final marks you will get are also not indicated by the CI. It is important that you read and understand the tasks and implement that specification correctly. The tests that are provided are meant to help you get started with code development, but the tests are not the specification definition.  

- Frequently check for announcements on the Wattle frontpage.

- For question-related issues (e.g., suspected a bug in the question), you may contact us using the Wattle message functionality to send private message (contacts on the Wattle frontpage).
